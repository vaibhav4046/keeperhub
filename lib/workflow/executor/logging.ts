 * the durable workflow_execution_logs rows so success terminations can still
 * persist the full list.
 *
 * Ordered by started_at ASC so the array matches submission order even when
 * an SDK fan-out completes out of submit order. Deduped by hash string so SDK
 * retries that re-broadcast (same logical step, two distinct hashes) keep the
 * first-seen entry. nodeId-keyed dedupe would incorrectly collapse legitimate
 * For-Each iterations that share a nodeId.
 *
 * Optional fields are omitted from the entry when not present in output_raw
 * (or, for iterationIndex, when the log row is for a non-loop node), matching
 * the in-process harvester's shape so consumers see a uniform JSON regardless
 * of which path populated the column.
 *
 * Returns [] on query failure -- losing the hash list is preferable to
 * failing the UPDATE that flips status to success.
 *
 * Success rows only: this list feeds the KEEP-966 reconciliation gate, which
 * re-verifies every entry as an expected SUCCESSFUL receipt. A failing run's
 * broadcasts are harvested separately by loadFailureBroadcasts, which must not
 * feed that gate.
 *
 * The transactionHash IS NOT NULL filter is pushed into Postgres so a workflow
 * that runs a non-tx step many times (e.g. a For-Each over hundreds of HTTP
 * calls) does not stream every row back to Node just to discard it in JS.
 * The JS-side type guard below stays as the authoritative check: SQL only
 * confirms the key exists in output_raw, not that the value is shaped like a
 * hash for the chain the step reported. That shape check is shared with the
 * in-memory tracker (isRecordableTransactionHash) so the two reconstructions
