Rotate to a NEW key ONLY if this is genuinely different work. If it is the same intent you already sent, the body drifted rather than the intent - re-serializing `0.1` as `0.10`, or `network` for `chainId`, produces this - so rebuild the body to match the original and keep the key.

/**
 * Tool annotation policy.
 *
 * Clients use these hints to decide what to auto-approve, so an inaccurate
 * hint is a security control failure, not a cosmetic one. The MCP spec
 * defaults are readOnlyHint=false, destructiveHint=true, idempotentHint=false
 * and openWorldHint=true, and destructiveHint/idempotentHint are only
 * meaningful when readOnlyHint is false. Writing `destructiveHint: false` is
 * therefore an explicit downgrade away from the safe default and must be
 * justified per tool.
 *
 * Rules applied here:
 *  - readOnlyHint: true only when the tool reads and computes and changes no
 *    state anywhere, including in other orgs and on chain. It must never
 *    contradict the read/write split in oauth-scopes.ts.
 *  - destructiveHint: false only for writes that are purely additive -- they
 *    create a new record that starts inert, overwrite and destroy nothing,
 *    and emit nothing outside the platform.
 *  - destructiveHint: true for anything that overwrites existing state, moves
 *    value, broadcasts a transaction, changes public exposure, sends an
 *    unrecallable outbound message, or dispatches or arms an execution whose
 *    effects we cannot bound from the arguments alone.
 *  - idempotentHint and openWorldHint are left at their spec defaults: every
 *    write here is unsafe to blind-retry (several take an explicit
 *    idempotency_key for exactly that reason) and every tool can reach an
 *    external system, so the defaults are already the conservative values.

    "Get combined status and step-by-step logs for a workflow execution. Replaces the v1.11 get_execution_status + get_execution_logs pair. Returns { status, logs } in a single response. `status` and each log's `transactionHashes[].verified`/`receiptStatus` are independently reconciled against on-chain receipts before the execution is allowed to finalize as success -- this, not execute_workflow's trigger acknowledgement, is the authoritative signal for whether a workflow (and any money movement within it) actually completed. By default returns full node input/output data (backward compatible with v1.11 get_execution_logs no-param callers), except that any single input/output/outputRaw payload above 1 MiB is returned as a { _truncated, originalSize, preview } marker. Pass `includeData: false` to omit input/output/outputRaw blobs, `nodeIds: string[]` to restrict full data to specific nodes (status and error always returned for every node), or `truncateData: number` (bytes) to cap individual input/output/outputRaw payloads. The `error` field is never truncated. One exception to the shape: for an execution owned by another organization that you can see only through its workflow's public share setting, `logs` is null and `status` is redacted (node identifiers omitted) -- includeData, nodeIds and truncateData have no effect there.",
