 *
 * Returns `fallback: false` (a terminal error result) whenever the sponsored
 * transaction is already committed on Turnkey's side -- it either reverted
 * on-chain, or was accepted but not yet confirmed. Re-sending in those cases
 * would broadcast a second transaction from the same wallet and race the
 * sponsored one. Returns `fallback: true` only for genuine pre-broadcast
 * failures, where direct signing is safe.
 *
 * Shared by every web3 write step so the "never double-send" rule stays
 * identical across write-contract, transfer-token, approve-token, and
 * transfer-funds.
